# Generic-CSV-Importer

An Extension for the Fantasy Gounds VTT that provides the ability to import CSV files into formatted tables in basic Story entries and Advanced Story entries. The tools looks for #table# in the story entry and will replace it with a formatted table of data based on the content of the CSV file selected.

For extension to work properly, you will need to download a Zip of all the files, change the .ZIP extension to .ext, then move the file into your FGU Extensions folder. When you start FGU, you will need to search for "Feature: Generic VSC Importer" under Extensions and select it.
